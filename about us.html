            <p> February 2020, </p>

             <p> Dear Parents/Guardians </p>   

              <p>  It is hard to believe that is February and we have completed half of the school year. This is the time
                of year that we reflect on our goals and where we are on our journey towards their completion. This is
                also the time of year we reflect on the achievements of the many diverse cultures that make up the PS
                315K Learning Community. February marks the celebration of African American History Month. During this
                time, we celebrate the notable African- American people that have helped shape our country. We will be
                highlighting one notable person in African- American History daily during this month. </p>

            <p>   February is also a focal month for “Respect for All”. This speaks to the diversity of the many cultures,
                ethnicities, religions, gender identity, and beliefs that exist within the school community. February
                10th through the 14th marks “Respect for All” Week in all New York City public schools. During this week
                and throughout the month we will be emphasizing a “Respect for All” environment. Bullying, including
                cyberbullying, intimidation, and bias-based harassment have no place in our schools or communities, and
                we all need to work together to address this issue. It is a top priority for all of us to maintain a
                safe and supportive learning environment that is free from bullying and harassment, intimidation, and/or
                discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship/immigration
                status, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, weight or disability. </p>
            

            <p> “Respect for All” Week is designed to continue the focus on the importance of promoting respect for
                diversity and creating inclusive school climates so that all students and other members of the school
                community feel safe and respected. All of us grapple with issues of respect every day. Teaching children
                to respect others is a shared responsibility. During this week, we will be focusing on showing respect
                in different ways. Making kindness chains, giving “put-ups” instead of “put-downs”, celebrating the
                diversity of our school community, and embracing our differences as we are all representative of the
                vast array of cultures. We ask each of you to reinforce the” Respect For All “message that students will
                be hearing in school – that all students deserve to be treated with respect, and that bullying,
                harassment, intimidation, and discrimination have no place in our school community.</p>

            <p>  Thank you for your continued support of your child’s education. Please know that we are united in our
                commitment to promoting respect for diversity and fostering inclusive learning environments for all
                students and that we will do all we can to help make African American History Month/ Respect For All
                Week/ and Multicultural Week a success.</p>
